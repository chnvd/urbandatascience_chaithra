    "So far, we've got some text into Python from a PDF, cleaned it up, and split the string into sentences and words. We've also done simple word counts. Now, we'll see what topic modeling - one method under the broader umbrella of natural language processing - can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two examples in urban studies that use topic modeling are [Han et al.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01944363.2020.1831401) who analyze election communications, and [Brinkley & Stahmer](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0739456X21995890) who analyze General Plans. But let's say a little about the principles first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling is a method to identify patterns in text documents. It's an *unsupervised* machine learning technique, i.e. it doesn't need to be \"trained\" on a dataset of known topics. Rather, it identifies topics from the ground up. \n",
    "\n",
    "In that sense, topic modeling is related to cluster analysis. However, a document can belong (partially) to multiple topics, where an observation is typically assigned to a single cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "But both cluster analysis and topic modeling perform *dimensionality reduction*. Suppose we have 1000 distinct words in a document, that we reduce to 10 topics. We are going from a 1000-dimensional space to a 10-dimensional space. Obviously, 10 dimensions are much easier to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several algorithms that implement topic modeling; we'll focus on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (as in the Han et al. paper). We'll use the `gensim` library, although `sklearn` is a popular alternative. `gensim` is dedicated to NLP, while `sklearn` is a more general machine-learning library.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with looking at a selection of Climate Action Plans (CAPs) from cities and counties in California. These are some of the plans I analyzed [in a project on equity in CAPS](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0739456X211072527) with Hillary Angelo, Key MacFarlane, and James Sirigotis. Thanks to these collaborators for permission to share this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plans are in a directory in your GitHub repository. We can see the list using `os`."

Zero Waste Additional CityRelated Emission Reduction Programs Land Use Mobility Natural Environment Community Vitality Safety Noise Appendix Emission Reduction Targets based on programs Introduction The Mill Valley Climate Action Plan was adopted as part of the Mill Valley General Plan October Language contained in this Climate Action Plan are excerpts from the larger Mill Val ley General Plan that is available at wwwcityofmillvalleyorg generalplan Purpose Climate change is caused by an increase in the concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases Potential climate change impacts in Northern California include declining water supplies spread of disease diminished agricultural productivity sea level rise and in creased incidence of wild re ooding and landslides Like many communities Mill Valley is addressing these potential impacts by thinking differently about its resources taking actions to reduce the communitys contribution to greenhouse gas production and identifying strategies to allow the community to adapt to potential foreseen changes While the Climate Action Element is not a mandatory element of the General Plan the City of Mill Valley has designed the MV General Plan so that it also serves as the Citys Climate Action Plan identifying the ways in which the City will comply with state mandates for reducing greenhouse gas emissions Greenhouse gas GHG emission reduction policies and programs are identi ed throughout this element and the rest of the General Plan with a In addition an assessment of potential reduc leaf symbol tion in GHG emissions based on the emission reduction measures in the MV General Plan is included in Appendix C of this Gen eral Plan Existing Conditions Overview of Climate Change The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC the authoritative global scienti c consortium on climate change has provided overwhelming scienti c evidence that hu maninduced greenhouse gas GHG emissions are now produc ing climate impacts with dangerous consequences According to MILL VALLEY CLIMATE ACTION PLAN S E A L E V E L R I S E Projected will expand the areas subject to ooding to include lowlying areas of Mill Valley from Bothin Marsh to Sycamore Park research by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and James Hansen NASAs Chief Climate Scientist recent global emissions trend lines if unchanged are likely to produce the following Temperature Average temperatures could increase as much as degrees Fahrenheit F by the end of the century with F considered the tipping point beyond which runaway climate impacts including full melting of the polar ice are inevitable Fire Risk The occurrence of large wild res could increase by as much as to percent Water Availability By the average April measurement of the Sierra snowpack will drop by feet resulting in a loss of percent of Californias water supply These impacts will dramatically increase competition for scarce water resources severely reduce the states agricultural production and further intensify the frequency and duration of droughts Public Health The frequency and intensity of conditions con ducive to air pollution harsh heat and vector borne disease will increase Sea Level Rise Sea levels could rise from as little as to feet if emissions trend downward to as much as to feet by the end of the century if emissions continue to rise in a busi ness as usual scenario Between and sea level rise on San Francisco Bay un derneath the Golden Gate was seven inches primarily due to ther mal expansion from global warming and this rate of increase is accelerating According to the Bay Conservation and Development Commission BCDC September report A Sea Level Rise Strategy for the San Francisco Bay Region Recent analyses indicate that sea level rise from warming oceans may be meters about inches over the next years or even higher depending upon the rate at which glaciers and other ice sheets on land melt BCDCs illustrative maps show that a onemeter rise in the level of the Bay could ood over square miles of land and development around the Bay Initial estimates indicate that over billion worth of public and private development could be at risk San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission A Sea Level Rise Strategy for the San Francisco Bay Region September httpwww

    "Remember that the `LdaMulticore` function takes the `num_topics`, `alpha` and `eta` parameters. We could adjust those. We might also want to exclude certain uninformative words based on our present context — perhaps \"city\" or \"climate.\"\n",
